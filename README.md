# Capstone-Project

My Idea for my capstone project is to create an automatic smart lighting system powered by a raspberry PI!
This Pi will access the internet and read when the predicted for sunset will be for that day. It will then power a transistor to flip you lights on and off for the day automatically. It will also have a manual input for overriding its auto features.
